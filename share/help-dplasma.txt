[gpu_alloc_failed]
There was not enough memory available on a GPU device
while trying to allocate a %s handle to manage tasks on
this device, or another GPU device on the node. The
PaRSEC runtime system may be configured to reserve too
much memory on GPU devices. Try reducing the amount of
reserved memory by setting the PaRSEC MCA parameter
'device_cuda_memory_use' (or similar for the type of
device) to a lower value.
