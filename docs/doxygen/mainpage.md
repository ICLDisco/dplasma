Distributed PLASMA

## Purpose of DPLASMA 

The main purpose of DPLASMA is to provide a distributed version of the
[PLASMA - Parallel Linear Algebra for Scalable Multi-core Architectures](http://icl.cs.utk.edu/plasma)
library targetting distributed multicore processors and multi-socket
systems of multicore processors. DPLASMA overcomes the inability to
efficiently utilize accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units
(GPUs) in libraries like [LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/) and
[ScaLAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/scalapack/). It provides
routines to solve dense general systems of linear equations, symmetric
positive definite systems of linear equations and linear least squares
problems, using LU, Cholesky, QR and LQ factorizations. Real
arithmetic and complex arithmetic are supported in both single
precision and double precision.

## Where to find more information

The main repository for DPLASMA documentation is the distribution
./docs directory. DPLASMA documentation, and PaRSEC documentation is
also available online on the respective websites:
http://icl.utk.edu/dplasma/ and http://icl.utk.edu/parsec. For
installation instructions please refer to the
[PaRSEC wiki page](https://github.com/icldisco/parsec/wiki/Home)
and [DPLASMA wiki page](https://github.com/icldisco/dplasma/wiki/Home).

In addition, the repository issue tracking systems for
[DPLASMA](https://github.com/icldisco/dplasma/issues) or
[PaRSEC](https://github.com/icldisco/parsec/issues) can be used
to post general questions and comments as well as to report technical
problem.
